	 GITS/YEAR_src_PLAY_PREP/
	 readme.md

	libs_apps was the main place
	YEAR_src_PLAY is the second place (libs_apps is itself there)
	YEAR_src_PLAY/SCRATCH_ZONE is stuff not good enough for PLAY but in it anyway
	YEAR_SRC_PLAY_PREP is to PREP attempts before moving them to PLAY

	YEAR_SRC_PLAY_PREP_pre is not on GIT

	A lot of PLAY is individual MODULES that work ASIS part of libs_apps
	So at every level, things can be moved in and out of their layers.

	Currently SM_one is a bit like SCRATCH_ZONE_20/in_C++_SM2/
	and like /YEAR_src_PLAY/libs_apps/src/lib_base2/js_sm/
	NONE of them work !!
