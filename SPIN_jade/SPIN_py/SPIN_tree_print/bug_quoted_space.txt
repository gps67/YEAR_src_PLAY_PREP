print_tree should handle:

	<TAG attr="quoted string with spaces">

and ensure that wrap_point() isnt called within the string.
EG SVG witha  lot of attribute might hit this

ALSO:
	wrap_point combined with queued_spaces
	tracks location of the next character
	if overflow, divert away, splice CRLF_Indent, replace
	Plus: try to keep low number of trailing "> in same line
