Setup_Paths_Install

	You have to edit a few paths until it works.

	If you use the pre-compiled files you have to install
	the libraries where LD_LIBRARY_PATH finds them.

	If you build from source, you will need to edit the makefile
	MK_SPIN_site to set the python paths, and others.

	When you run the scripts, they will need to find /etc/sgml
	or some relative path that I've hardcoded somewhere. see

		tests_number/dtd/base/spin_eh.py # etc_sgml
		# normally you dont edit this base class file

	Within /etc/sgml you have catalog files which know where to
	find the DTD for HTML4 (point to SP's pubtext dir). EACH FILE
	listed in the catalog must exist, or you get an error! so you
	must edit:

		tests_number/dtd/etc_sgml/catalog # files must exist
	

	When you run the scripts, they will need to find the sub-scripts
	which can most easily be done by setting shell $PATH, or by
	setting it within the scripts.

	When testing from within Apache/mod_python, its sets sys.path[0]
	to the dir where the script was named, which might confuse you.

	Methinks - I've added so many paths to help you, I've confused things.
