# this wont work when .so is REQUIRED
# but it does build sgmlnorm (and others)
# which is a speed reference check
# to install this do the following:
#	mkdir _build_16_a
#	cd    _build_16_a
#	ln -s ../SPIN_py/Makefiles/MK_SPIN_16_a .
#	./MK_SPIN_16_a
# and a tree of objext files will appear
# now repeat for _build_8_so and other 8/16 .so/.a varients (edit each time)
# you must also ln -s /usr/src/sp/_build_16_so_g/libs/* /opt/lib/
# so that they are found at run time (along with LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
# I use an intermediary link in /usr/src/sp/libs
# make clean and make install are missing

# this is the "not-debugging, un-shared, unicode version"
# thats 3 binary options making (upto) 8 builds
# you might also want TCL to be .so or .a, edit to suit
# NB Python doesn't dirctly do unicode, it gets chopped to 8859
# NB spin_sp.so supposedly REQUIRES either libso.so 
# or .a  to be linked into the Python binary (eg HP/UX)

# the role of the top level makefile is to make the subdirs
# the role also includes setting (1) debug (2) shared lib (3) unicode
# the role of this file is a preamble to the main file

# switch debug off and opim on

	OPT_DEBUG=
	OPT_OPTIM=-O2

# select 16-bit unicode not 8-bit 8859, 
# thats a compilation flag AND part of the libsp16-1.3 name
# ie sp16g-1.3


	OPT_CSET=-DSP_MULTI_BYTE 
	OPT_LIBNAME=sp16-1.3

# this is the un-shared .a ...

	# compile all code with pos dep code and global vectors
	OPT_PIC=

	# filename calculation
	OPT_LIB_EXT=a

	# link with -shared
	# OPT_SHARED=-shared
	# not required as it's hard coded into rule that creates .a||.so!

# now include the generic rest of this makefile
