#	mkdir _build_8_a
#	cd    _build_8_a

# now repeat for _build_8_so and other varients (edit each time)
# you must also ln -s /usr/src/sp/_build_8_a_g/libs/* /opt/lib/
# so that you can run them (along with LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
# I use an intermediary link in /usr/src/sp/libs
# make clean and make install are missing

# this is the "not-debugging, un-shared, unicode version"
# thats 3 binary options making (upto) 8 builds
# you might also want TCL to be .so or .a, edit to suit
# NB Python doesn't dirctly do unicode, it gets chopped to 8859

# the role of the top level makefile is to make the subdirs
# the role also includes setting (1) debug (2) shared lib (3) unicode
# the role of this file is a preamble to the main file

# switch debug off and opim on
