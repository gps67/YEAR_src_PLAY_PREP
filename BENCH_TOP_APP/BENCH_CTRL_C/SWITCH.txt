TOP_APP_gtk
TOP_APP_WAX_gtk // update from pre Gtk2 to Gtk4 // w_WIDGET // no _t // drop w_

SCRIPT is compiled into CXX into C++ /* simple subset mostly */ /* gcc_latest */SCRIPT is compiled into C within C++ program // API C++ compiled but C style
SCRIPT can then add FEATURE into use // no-longer C now C++
subset OOP MATCH OBJV with SCRIPT with Py_Obj with TclObj with V8_OBJ
avoid C++ features that YOU cant replace with JavaScript over MMAP_ACCESS

MMAP ACCESS enforces some sort of OUTER P0P2 LIMITS
MMAP OUTER often BEYOND INSIDE EDGE_P0P2 LIMITS
