		CT_RT 
			creates a var
			ALWAYS INIT NULL

			PRE_LOAD KNOWN VALUE SCRIPT DATA

		initialise as part of alloc
		initialise in PRE_LOAD alloc deferred



	resource 
	aquisition
	IS
	initialisation


		ie CTOR must do open( FILENAME )
		ie CTOR must know FILENAME or DONOR_OBJECT or AN_ARG
	
	ALTERNATIVE

	"YOU_DONT_EXIST_x_GO_AWAY"

		when XYZ becomes available

		CT_RT lays its eggs here
	
	ITEM_t * ITEM = NOT_NULL_PTR
	ITEM_t * ITEM = NOT_NULL_PTR__EXPR

		option to return an EXPR for CT_RT eval

		 option i64_DECODED
		 option i64_PTR
		 option i32_i32_ENCODED
		 option i32_DECODED
		 option i32_PTR

		option for FAIL_CTOR to return NULL
	
	DEFERRED_RAII

		deals with the UNSET ERA
		deals with CTOR_FAIL
	
	RECYCLED_RAII

		preallocated cache vars
		reused each loop
		is better SCOPE converted to C decl at top 
		or decl at block
	
		saves MALLOC

	DEFINITE_ZERO_OVER

		DTOR does ZERO_OVER
		SCOPE_END_does ZERO_OVER

		want to reduce the SCOPE_END task
		loops reuse BYTES
		FSM STATES {
			RANDOM
			ZERO
		}

		ZONE_BYTES_START
		LOOP_SCOPE_START
		LOOP_SCOPE_END
		LOOP_SCOPE_CYCLE
		ZONE_SCOPE_END
