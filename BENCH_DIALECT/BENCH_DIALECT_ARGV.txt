	BENCH_SCRIPT is the propername, but it is (not) in an adjacent folder

		we need a BASE_CLASS_BENCH_SCRIPT
		with NAME "BASE_CLASS"

			STR0 as a TOKEN is LANGUAGE ITEM LEX

			STR0_at_XPOS
			P0P2_as_XPOS
	
	STR0_at_XPOS

	 REQUIRE_FILTER 

	 	use P0P2
		instead of STR0

	use NBYTES over P0P2 at XPOS.P0

		LANG defines MENTION
		LANG outlines RULES for MENTION and USAGE
		LANG predicts USAGE with LIBR_API // HTH // FUNC AVAR 

	MENTION is AVAR
	MENTION is FUNC // GETTER // SETTER // BEHAVIOUR // eg PROVIDES_COPY_MEM

		AVAR might be ambiguous NOUNT or FUNCTION
		FUNCTION might gather ARGS from SCOPE around XPOS

		COPY of nbytes available unchanged ... HERE ...
		COPY of SPELLING ... HERE ... normalise( i64_EA_SPELLING )

			EA is ACCESS to CACHED COPY
			EA is ACCESS to ADJUSTED COPY
			EA is ACCESS to WRITE_BACK COPY

				OK compiler semantics are all CT_RT stuff
				EA is probably an OBJ with EA as a field
				OBJ brings i64_BITFIELDS

					i8_i8
					i16
					i32

				I think that most CPU_32's
				have at least one register 
				that can bitshift i64
				
				But instead I have a base class

					i32_i32
					it has
					i8_i8_i16_i32 getters

						implementation BITFIELD_WORD
						implementation WORD_PAIR

						WORD_in_MEM
						WORD_in_CPU
						HALF_WORD_in_TRANSIT

						you use HALF where you find it
						NEAR if you CALL it from there
						ASIF ROM asif RAM to EDIT but unchanged

	ASIF ROM asif RAM to EDIT but unchanged

	!!	LANG harvests from nearby available LEX

		at the moment I have to live within a SUBSET

 !!! === > 	in this SUBSET I make use of things that do not exist
 eg MENTION
 eg IMPORT ABSENT

		API defined, but noone implements it
	
	WANT AUTO_GEN_ABSENT

		DIALECT adds IMPLIED

	IMPLIED NO means OK # simply an OPTION not being PICK'd

		IMPLIED NO means OK # simply an OPTION not being PICK'd
		IMPLIED NO means UNSET # so default behaviour, is to do nothing
		IMPLIED NO means ALARM # crown jewels expected
		IMPLIED NO means FAST_MATCH ITEM_NULL # so default behaviour

			CODE thinks it can implement FEATURE
			CODE thinks it cant implement FEATURE # but needs it
			PICK know CODE has OPTIONS
			PICK know CODE is PICK of OPTIONS

		IMPLIED NO means INIT_NULL # crown jewels expected

		when ABSENT is is_ABSENT detecting NULL_ABSENT and other ALIAS
		behave as if OPTION # current choice is NULL # NULL_MEANS_OK_NO
	OPTION
