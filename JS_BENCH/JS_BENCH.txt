BENCH is the local configured BENCH for this Modules development LOCN

JS_BENCH is the code required to make it happen

	Not JS_NODE/JS_BENCH

		it exists in the client browser
		it exists in the server NODE as LOCN_BENCH
	
	Probably uses some over simplistic CLASS tree
	of objects that BENCH edits for Module
	of PSG_ITEM_of_CODE in Module itself

		PSG will need some long term stability

		BENCH has API into PSG which should stabilise
