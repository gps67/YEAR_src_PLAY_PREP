with Python event loop
with Python calling script

	build parallel systems
	build Tcl systems that Python can call

tricky bits

	refcounting from bind statements
	refcounting - TODO_DOCS
	callbacks from

easy bits

	how TKINTER is designed to repeat the patterns
	how TKINTER is designed to channel the patterns

repeat bits

	rework as Tcl then call from Python

	but first do it in Python
	to understand callables that hold data
	(not quite closures)
