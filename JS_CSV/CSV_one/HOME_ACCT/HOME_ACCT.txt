	 CT_RT reduces it down to * which is easy enough to read
	 CT_RT attaches to VALUE or to AVAR_of_VALUE
	 CT_RT expects API to provide SESS.SESS.G_rrr
	 # SESS is a field instead of our container # semantics after that #
	 # provide SESS.SESS # somehow #
	 # SESS.SESS is a C_BUILTIN and blindingly fast #
	 # SESS.SESS.G_rrr is LIBR_WARN_API that once worked surprisningly well
	 # sort of # OS says file does not exist # ENOENT # other avail info

	 TYPE DECL SPEC used by API = REPORT_EXPLAIN_to_GUI
	 DECL SPEC is CXX struct # DECL CXX_STRUCT_amd_SCRIPT
	 Module provides a rich bunch of options

	SNAPSHOT as REPORT and its PRINT moment _NOW

		_NOW forces AVAR for that NAME
		NAME == "NOW" // OPTION == // OPTION = // OPTION lhs opcode rhs

			TEMPLATE can place lhs opcode rhs in FILTERED ARGS

			 AVAR lhs ALIAS LHS TYPE LHS_t 

			 	seems trite
				but that is the flavour that tells AUTO to GEN
				GEN LHS_t // OFTEN "ITEM_t" // ALIAS "%s_t" //
				Each RULE has MATCH EXPR RULE TITLE ARGS ETC

		IDX allocates an u7_IDX u15_IDX u31_IDX u63_IDX

		MATCH is_PLUS
		MATCH is_ZERO
		else
		MATCH is_MINUS {
			This CODE is IDX and only deals with is_PLUS
			This CODE is PLUS IDX MINUS PUZZLE_to_get_answer

			ie is_PLUS is ARRAY[ IDX ] of EIGHT

			CPU_32 has options when looking at i64

			MATH register i256_unlikely i64_likely

				LIBR uses C stanza to see as i32_i32_in_MEM
				_in_MEM
				_in_CPU_as_MATH_REGISTER_%s
				_in_CPU_as_PAIR_REGISTER_%s_%s

			LANG decoder

				when caller calls the same expr time and again
				they invoke a CACHE_API for that "SPELLING"
				CT_RT detects NOUN in landscape of SCRIPT
				CT_RT asks CACHE for API
				CACHE provides API for CT_RT to use

			CACHE reports all LISTENERS DONE
			CACHE learns from TEST_SCRIPTS
			CACHE learns from LIVE_DATA
			nb we are HOME_ACCTS which fits on 20K csv for 7 years

				MENTION means NOUN says own name "SPELLING"
				MENTION to TOKEN to BINDING to AVAR in SESS

			We can write ROM by running a MINI_MACHINE with STO
			ROM = STO after mk_ROM says DONE
