	 	this bribgs in SPEC ZONE HEAP ITEM NBYTES STO ROM 

	 	this brings in IDX_GROW within INT_SPLIT

			u7 in i8
			u15 in i16
			u31 in i32
			u63 in i54

		that brings in LIBR_BITFIELD

			idx_grow shifts gear to BITWIDTH

			some historic fork preserved and derived identity
			some historic fork merged into a running POOL
			some historic fork add mostly 
			some historic reload from IMAGE_one and run FILTER_one

			BITFIELD detect and differs i32_i32 or passes to C

				C on CPU_32 
				can often do i64 in 2 registers or OTHER

				LIBR provides >> to C # as ASM when C_MACRO_INVOKED
				SCRIPT and CXX and C++ provide "int >>"

	the reason we only have 4 options _one and _two
	is so that GEN can write out 4 LINES of PARALLEL ALTERNATIVE CODE LINES
	LINE is a STANZA # wrapped as LINE_FRAGMENT # CSET_AUTO_ASCII_BYTE_UTF8

CSET_AUTO_ASCII_BYTE_UTF8

	At the heart of our Parser is what it finds within the easiest CSET

		additional
		 CSET_ATTS += is_ASCII is_GLYPH is_PUNCT is_GAP is_WITHIN_GAP
	
	is_GAP

		We write a template Parser for (this purpose)
		WE wrap its parameters in SCRIPT at XPOS and SESS at EA_EXPR

			EA_of_ITEM
			EA_of_XPOS
			EA_of_MMAP
			EA_as_OFFS_from_ZERO

				UPPER ZERO makes it exist # CTOR XPOS SESS
				UPPER ZERO makes it AVAR
				UPPER OFFS makes it AVAR 

			This (above) stanza binds to SPELLING TOKEN "%s"

			 AVAR ZERO XPOS
			 AVAR OFFS XPOS

			 	API OPTION allow "TEXT" as alternative "EMIT"
			 	API OPTION allow "-" as alternative "OMIT"

				"-" means NULL_ARGV_ITEM
				"-" means NULL_HEAP_ITEM

		is_PUNCT
		is_GAP # or rather: PUNCT is within PARSED_LEX_GAP
	
	MINI_MACHINE obeys the above SCRIPT that uses CSET_AUTO_ASCII_BYTE_UTF8

	 MINI_MACHINE obeys SCRIPT FEATURE like AVAR of SPEC with PERMIT_API

	 	API is a getter, setter, that can be run over the WAN 
		API_BATCH are some tools to help you write a BATCH
		API_BATCH reacts on REMOTE and has MATCH_on_NULL _MINUS _PLUS

			The alternative is an ONLINE round_trip_with_ANSWERS

				Even that is a MINI_BATCH
				And that is where we are SCRIPTING 

				Entire BATCH completes and returns REPLY
				CYCLE BATCH

			One alternative is LOCAL and DIRECT

				or as close as API like

				CXX can use C++ DECL # albeit a DAFT subset

			The alternative is DELAYED_and_FILTERED

				append changes to change list
				apply changes to pruned growing tree

			on_COMPLETE_inner_list_DONE

				send the tree back - or on to next
				(iee retval is a zero_point RET_VAL_NOW _valid
			
				MATCH { with its } on_PUNCT # PSG writes this

				send_tree {
				 sweep tree foreach LOCN sweep_and_MATCH
				 sweep LOCN foreach LOCN sweep_and_MATCH
				 sweep LOCN foreach ITEM sweep_and_MATCH

				 	ITEM's can easily themselves be LOCN
					a sub-world that appears by magic
					though someone needs to write LIBR 

					gets here on a MENTION # import LIBR #

					sweep left to right
					sweep SCRIPT using XPOS

					 use EA is XPOS_in_SCRIPT

				 flush all ENQ within ACTION

					EDIT PREP_STREAM
				 	insert a MARKER into the PREP_STREAM
					set CSR to BEFORE that CANNOT CROSS
					set CSR to SPLIT CSR and PAGE_TAIL

					arrange that DEFER COMPLETE LIST
					does eventually get completed
					does contribute a BUFFER SECTION
					# articulated SECTIONS from PHASES
					BUFF.stream_buffer_in_AVAR # OPTS
					# OPTS NULL CT_RT optimiser
					# OPTS += COPY_ASAP_then_release_HOLD
					# OPTS HOLD += COPY_SCOPED_HOLD_TWIG

				REQUEST return ROUTE

					back to sender (callers _NOW point)
					LOCAL created BATCH and here is RET_VAL
					want it to arrive SOON
					want it to arrive after PREVOUS_in_CHAIN

					PARTIAL_BATCH comes from early reply
					Single ENQ can have a few ACK waves SEQ

					CALLER provided BATCH.INFO .STO .ROM

						REMOTE provides ROM
						ROM happens to be UDEF_SCRIPT
						CT_RT matches by FILE SAME_FILE
						CT_RT uses PRE_LOAD_ROM
						CT_RT requires ROM be in SAFE

				SAFE_MODE_CODE

					all external requests go through FILTER
					UDEF FILTER LIST
					 VFS_API provides a VFS
					 VFS_API uses LOCAL and REMOTE thinking

					VFS_API provides a twig_of_files

					 DIR DIR
					 DIR FILE
					 DIR symb_link
					 DIR PIPE_SOCKET_CDEV_BDEV_UNIX_FILE

				
				VFS FEATURE

					read TEXT_FILE
					build VFS from that
					add features to VFS
					merge VFS_TEXT_LINES into VFS

					MUX_TEXT ARGV0 has special match EARLY
					MUX_TEXT LINE _BOLN _cpos _bpos
