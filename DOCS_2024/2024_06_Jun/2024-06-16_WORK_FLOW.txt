	in_field might mean WAN_down LAN_up

		we are using BT or LAN - they are up
		GW uses WAN which may be up or down, short-term long-term

	in_field might mean untrusted GW

		the software has to be trusted
		it sees the unencrypted files

			unless we can install a module on the device
			but why should anyone let us
			we cant trust our bugs
			code enable a lot of simplified access

		- eg MMAP words into ARGV using SPELLING - FREE_REPEATS %s
		- so MMAP HEAP can be ARGV and [V] VECTOR_ITEM[X] x == "idx"
		- DIALECT provides hungry hook for '{ "idx" }'
		- SPELLING applied to every ARGV STR0
		- MATCH SPELLING - STR0 is EA of STR0 in MEM
		- MATCH SPELLING - STR0 is EA of STR0 at OFFS in MMAP
		- MATCH SPELLING - PSG of above match all of this
		- MATCH SPELLING - BIND AVAR to SPELLING of AVAR_EXPR
		- MATCH_TOKEN - ITEM in STREAM or MMAP does not have BIND
		- LOCAL_PICK_from_AVAR_NAME idx "idx" -
		- USES SCRIPT DIALECT FEATURE STR0 is VAR_NAME is BIND_AVAR_EXPR
		- USES_SCRIPT_DIALECT_REATURE_BIND is AVAR "AVAR"

			You have to get the Q1 and Q2 correct
			but we set a simple standard for simple declarations
			Q1 Q2 rules - mostly like C but Q1 on the outside
			Q2 Q1 rules - Q1 appears inside the STR, Q2 is outside

			Q1_str - this is not proper C nor CXX - is Tcl
			Q2_str - this is proper C++ STR0 - almost

			COMPILER GEN has to overquote the generated CXX text
			RTFM and find a happy subset

	Personally I minimise, "it will be OK, it's not that bad. -etc-"
	and genuine attempts to fix the situation. It's a tina bit
	annoying, all that useless helpful suggestions, but if you
	zone out it becomes delightful, a friend making chit-chat. from
	what-ever's available.

	On the other hand, that helpful search for an answer to your
	predicament, is also a unit of gaslight, being played out, in some
	phase or stage found in of scene. It diminishes your struggles,
	your core, meh-what-problem, and it smudges them away. Oh ,
	and you.

	It also positions you as helpless, needing splinters of advice,
	when maybe you are letting on, about some texture in your life.
	It still needs eliminating, diminishing. It's gaslighting,
	but from social norms, as some sort of undertow.

	If you want the original "Gaslight" the Movie is available on ebay
	DVD, and delinquent download. So what does the word mean? Who
	knows, nut maybe: A stage was then lit by gaslight. The house
	lights flickered down, when he was in the attic, proving that
	someone was there, somewhere near the house.

	People often misquote that, as him playing with the lights,
	to instill flicking doubt, but it is him trying to be silent,
	but failing. It's kind of close. He did some of the other things
	intentionally.
