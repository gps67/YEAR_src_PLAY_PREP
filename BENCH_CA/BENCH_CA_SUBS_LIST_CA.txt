	Basically we will need to find a way to consisely wrap a signed TEXT

		SECRET has been passed under KEY_SECRET

		in plain_clear_text - because that is our internal API
		in plain_clear_text_slightly_hazed 
		- because that is our internal API - our IN


	CLIENT proves RSA_KEY of CERT HOLDER
		CLIENT = 
		RSA_KEY = _PRIV _PUBLIC
		CERT = _CERT
		HOLDER = MITM is a feature

			MITM takes SECRET away and refers to it by VAR_NAME

			MUX_MITM proves by
			use RSA_USER.PRIV

		DATA API allows extra DECL as in Module_DECL

			DESIGN invokes MENTION MK_AVAR %s`
			DESIGN invokes ALLOC _MINUS _ZERO _PLUS


		it appears in VFS as $FD_VFS _and_adjacent VARS
