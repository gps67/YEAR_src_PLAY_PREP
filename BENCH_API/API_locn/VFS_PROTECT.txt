		need ISO standard for A_FILE is HEAD_KEY_ONE_NBYTES

			ie KEY_ONE has to be decrypted using HEAD_info

				HEAD.info.key_two_over_key1.method .key_two_id

			ie KEY_TWO_id is how to obtain KEY_TWO

		GIT over those files, when KEYFILE is not under git

			here lies madness

o			but GIT zone under VFS for fast distribution of COPY_ALL

		VFS for TEAM moves ADIR over the CACHE horizon

			users volunteer early to drop access
			users fetch on demand - via FILTER ONLINE

			ADIR itself moves over horizon

		VFS moves ADIR away from WLAN to ARCHIVE_DRIVE
