		It started out as a TOPDIR,
		and it wants to stay as one

		It wants to be organised,
		as part of some code_group

		// FEATURE is name of code_group_API
		// FEATURE is old_name of code_group_API

	VFS_MAGIC_PEER

	VFS_file contains well known MIME_type.ext
	VFS_file_stat preserves mtime uid gid mod ... most with sane fake values
	// ie atime == mtime == ctime // default for XFER create file copy data

	VFS_STREAM does not do much with stat_time
	VFS_STREAM marks STREAM_IDLE at time
	VFS_STREAM marks STREAM_BLOCKED at time
	VFS_STREAM marks STREAM_BLOCKED_AGAIN_DETECT at time_average
	VFS_STREAM marks STREAM_FLUSHED_SEND at time
	VFS_STREAM marks STREAM_FLUSHED_ACK_from_REMOTE at time

		time is a magic number
		to be unique it should be after received was sent
		to be sensible it should be NOW checking for unexpected
		to be predictive it should be SOON // sleep_to_T2_flush( T2 )
		on_CALL( SELF, SESS )
		// SESS is a global variable anyway
		// CXX SCOPE assigns it to parameter of global
		// C API wasting 4 registers - so use those only (at these fns)
