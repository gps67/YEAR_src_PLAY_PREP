		ALIAS _BIOS_ 

		place this marker near any FIRMWARE or BIOS

 DROP ATTR as a FILE in VFS or as an FIELD in XML file

 	XML as GEN_XML for TREE_WALKERS to find

		ROM includes it's own DISASEMBLE with LISTINGS and XML notes
	
	ATTR is "ALIAS" // reflexively only defined by own mention and peer_load

		PEER_LOAD is how a PEER becomes a SURROUNDING WRAP
		WRAP_LOAD is how a PEER becomes a WRAP
		WRAP_LOAD is how a PEER becomes a FILTER
		WRAP_LOAD is how a PEER becomes a on_EVENT

			The WRAP_LOAD is enforced by LOADER
			When later modules are added to earlier CODE
			They can create features that did not exist before
			Those appear in the WRAP

			PERMIT to do this is also an issue
			PERMIT to edit this is also an issue

			SAFE_MODE may permit UDEF_FILTERS over DATA_STREAM
			Because SAFE_MODE has already PRE_FILTERED POST_

	ATTR is a zero size _BIOS_.txt filename

		PLUS non_zero TEXT contents 
		which may even invert the polarity of the option
		but BENCH should inform you of that # VIEW_RED # GREEN_VIEW
