 AVERAGE

 	an average is only any good, for a fixed thing

	eg the average height of 20-30 year olds
	makes some sort of sense,
	and forms that familiar bell shaped curve.
	They have stopped growing.

	eg the average height of a 0-10 year old,
	makes less sense because we know it varies with age,
	it is not a fixed number,
	it needs a better description,
	maybe a straight line or a curve,
	on the plot of a graph

fixed things vary

	eg a factory making capacitors
	eg a knackered machine in the factory

	measure each one that it produces,
	and calcuate the average and the variance

	A new machine might hardly vary at all,
	we live in an advanced engineering world.

	An old machine might wobble,
	and produce inconsistent items.
	The average for todays batch,
	and the variance found matter.

	It might not be possible to measure every capacitor,
	maybe in a box of 10,000 a small sample of 100 is picked.

	If we measured every one, we could simply reject the bad ones.
	Instead we choose to test less, and occasionally reject
	the entire box. Too much variance, means some of them PROBABLY
	MIGHT be out of SPEC. EG box labelled "accurate to 2%"

 AVERAGE

 	This is simply the sum of all the points,
	divided by the number of points.

 VARIANCE

 	This is simply the AVERAGE VARIANCE but slightly differently

	FIRST we compute the AVERAGE (there is a way of doing this - not last)

	EACH value of those 100 test results, has a DIFFERENCE from the AVERAGE

	In a parallel universe, we might calculate the AVERAGE DIFFERENCE.
		
		BUT there are as much PLUS as MINUS

		We could take the MATH.ABS( value ), the absolute value
		(of value) is the PLUS or the MINUS_MINUS_MAKES_PLUS

		That would work, but in our universe, we choose the SQUARE
		the DIFFERENCE (which exaggerates it) and also makes it PLUS.

		The ROOTED( AVERAGE( SQUARED( DIFFERENCE( of_EACH ))))

			each item is DIFFERENCE from average
			then squared
			then averaged by summing and divide by N
			then square_rooted (to sort of undo the initial square)

		So if a pencil factory makes 10cm pencils, varying by 1mm

			AVERAGE 10cm == 100 mm
			DIFF 0.5 1.0 1.5 ... 
			diff_squared 0.5 1.0 1.5 ... 

 ITEM X X-AVG SQUARED 
 1	 99.5
 2	100.5
 3       99.1
 4      100.9
 5       98.8
 6       
 7
 8
 9


	Firstly it is the SQUARE_ROOT of the SUM
