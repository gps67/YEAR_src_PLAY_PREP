	HEAP holds any number of TREE ROOTS
	GC is available 
	SYNC is available
	EDGE is available // EDGE pushes all available updates along 

		PSG_TREE has two parallel trees, PSG and DOC_TEXT as_TREE
		VFS is retains for sanity, and XPOS is FILE.LINE.CPOS
		VFS is retains for sanity, and P0P2 is Parsed nbytes of TEXT

			ZONE_nn	put first to keep P0P2 adjacent
			ZONE_P0P2

			 ZONE_P0
			 ZONE_P2

			XPOS_P0 = ZONE_P0
	OPTON		n_bytes_in_P0P2 = ZONE_nn 
	OPTON		n_bytes_in_P0P2 = P2 - P0
			XPOS_P2 = XPOS_P0 + n_bytes_in_P0P2
	INLINE		XPOS_P2 = XPOS_P0 + ZONE_nn



	EDGE = run to nothing left to eval ; sync xfer result as queue acts
	PLAY_LIST = PLAY_LIST_of_PATCH_STEPS_in_DIFF // VFS editing for TEXT

	SYNC_FLUSH is recommended at high tide 
	SYNC_EDGE is recommended at high tide 

		place a marker on all queues CSR_EDGE_PLACE_HOLDER
		place a marker P0P2 when N==0 PHRASE_TEXT_as_P0P2 // _FILE


		KEEP the XPOS of the STREAM
		as it flows through Parser_CXX
		TOKENISER uses idx = OFFS ++

		MATCH ALLOC idx = N ++
		MATCH ALLOC { p0 = N; N += nbytes_n; } 
		MATCH ALLOC P2 = P0 + nbytes_n
		MATCH ALLOC idx = P2
	
	SYNC STEP on_DONE release pre step

		TICK_TOCK

			whilst current ERA is incomplete or unacknowledged

			cannot rely on ERA
			can expect more changes within ERA
			so must remain in previous ERA_PRE_STEP
			until ENQ_ACK and COORDINATED STEP
			but since we known OLD_STEP is done
			we TICK_TOCK into new STEP_core_STEPPING
			database_version_git_era_daily_sort_of_stuff
	
	SYNC every FILE and wait for ALL_ACK but continue ERA upto then
	SYNC every ITEM streamed over GEN VFS
	SYNC_CLICK every Module imported over VFS
	EDGE_CLICK

		require MAKE_TARGET for modified VFS_LAYER_ON_OFF_STEP_DIFF
